### April 14, 2017
The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ - April 2017 release includes the following enhancements:

* **Improved Azure Sign In Experience**: The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ now supports two methods of logging into your Azure account: *Interactive* and *Automated*. For more information, see [Azure Sign In Instructions for the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ].
* **Publishing using Docker Containers**: You can now publish your web applications as Docker Containers using Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ. For more information, see [How to publish a Web App as a Docker Container using the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ].
* **Storage Account Management**: The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ now supports managing your storage accounts from the Azure Explorer View. For more information, see [Managing Storage Accounts using the Azure Explorer for IntelliJ].
* **Virtual Machine Management**: The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ now supports managing your virtual machines from the Azure Explorer Tool Window. For more information, see [Managing Virtual Machines using the Azure Explorer for IntelliJ].
* **Removal of Remote Debugging Support**. Remote debugging of Java web apps on Azure App Service has been removed from the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ; this was necessary to resolve some problems which customers were experiencing when using the toolkit.

### August 26, 2016
The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ - August 2016 release includes the following enhancements:

* **Custom JDK Distributions**. The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ now supports specifying and deploying an arbitrary JDK version to your Azure WebApp container:
  * In addition to the JDKs provided by Azure, you can also choose from a wide selection of Zulu OpenJDK versions made available on Azure by Azul Systems.
  * You can also specify your own JDK distribution if you upload it as a ZIP file to your storage account.
* **Enhancements to the Azure Explorer view**:
  * Support for Virtual Machine management using Azure's new Resource Manager model: you can list, create and delete resource manager-based virtual machines without leaving the IDE.
  * Support for Storage Account blob management using Azure's Resource Manager, which complements the existing functionality for managing "classic" storage accounts.
* **Microsoft JDBC Driver 6.0 for SQL Server**. This update includes the latest JDBC driver for Microsoft SQL Server (v6.0), which is now included as a library that you can easily add to your Java projects, thereby replacing the older version.

### June 29, 2016
The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ - June 2016 release includes the following enhancements:

* **Java 8 Requirement**. The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ now requires Java 8, although this requirement is only for the toolkit - your applications can continue to use all versions of Java that are supported by Azure.
* **Support for the latest Java JDKs**. The latest versions of the Java JDKs are now supported by the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ.
* **Support for Azure SDK v2.9.1**. The latest version of the Azure SDK is now the minimum pre-requisite for the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ.
* **Integrated Samples**. The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ now features several sample applications to help developers get started.
* **HDInsight Tool Integration**. Azure's HDInsight Tools are now bundled with the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ. For more information, see [HDInsight Tools Plugin for IntelliJ].
* **Remote Debugging of Java Web Apps**. The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ now supports remote debugging of Java web apps on Azure App Service.

### April 12, 2016
The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ - April 2016 release includes the following enhancements:

* **Support for Azure SDK v2.9.0**. The latest version of the Azure SDK is now the minimum pre-requisite for the Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ.
* **Miscellaneous usability, responsiveness and performance improvements related to Azure Web App support**. A number of performance optimizations in how the Toolkit communicates with Azure result in a more responsive UI.
* **Ability to delete an existing Web Application container in Azure from within IntelliJ**. The Azure Toolkit for IntelliJ now allows you to delete an existing Azure Web container without leaving IntelliJ.
